# passphrase_generator
Generate random passphrase from a list of words.
Even though the phrases are nonsense, they should be memorable because they're grammatically correct, making them easy for humans to remember, but hard for computers to guess. Inspired by XKCD.

eg:
- StormyHypocriticalBanana
- BlushingFaithfulVegetable
- ConfusedAromaticParrot
etc.
